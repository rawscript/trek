# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Buffer Dependency Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The Bluetooth service was using Node.js `Buffer` which isn't available in React Native.
**Solution**: Replaced Buffer usage with native JavaScript `atob()` and `Uint8Array` for base64 decoding.

### 2. **Missing Package Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `react-native-yandex-mapkit` package doesn't exist on npm.
**Solution**: Removed the non-existent package and implemented Yandex Maps using WebView with direct API integration.

### 3. **Conditional Import Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Native modules being imported on web platform causing crashes.
**Solution**: Added conditional imports for:
- `react-native-ble-plx` (mobile only)
- `react-native-permissions` (mobile only)  
- `react-native-webview` (mobile only)

### 4. **Permission Handling** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Permission requests failing when modules aren't available.
**Solution**: Added graceful fallbacks and proper error handling in permissions manager.

### 5. **WebView Property Typo** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `allowsInlineMediaPlaybook` should be `allowsInlineMediaPlayback`.
**Solution**: Fixed the typo in YandexMap component.

### 6. **Plugin Configuration** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Missing BLE plugin configuration in app.json.
**Solution**: Added proper react-native-ble-plx plugin configuration with permissions.

## Code Changes Made

### Services
- **bluetoothService.ts**: Complete rewrite with conditional imports and Buffer replacement
- **mapsService.ts**: Added marker color support for static maps
- **deviceService.ts**: Updated to use new Bluetooth service

### Components
- **YandexMap.tsx**: Rewritten with conditional WebView import and fallback to static maps
- **MapScreen.tsx**: Updated to use new location hook and platform-aware map rendering

### Utilities
- **permissions.ts**: Rewritten with conditional imports and graceful error handling
- **useLocation.ts**: New hook for cross-platform location services

### Configuration
- **app.json**: Added BLE plugin configuration and proper permissions
- **package.json**: Removed non-existent package, kept working dependencies

## Testing Recommendations

### Web Platform
1. ✅ Bluetooth should work with Web Bluetooth API
2. ✅ Maps should render with custom InteractiveMap component
3. ✅ Location should use browser geolocation API

### Mobile Platform (iOS/Android)
1. ✅ Bluetooth should work with react-native-ble-plx (if installed)
2. ✅ Maps should render with Yandex WebView (with static fallback)
3. ✅ Location should use Expo Location with proper permissions
4. ✅ Graceful fallbacks when native modules aren't available

## Potential Runtime Issues

### 1. **Missing Native Dependencies**
**Symptoms**: App crashes on startup or when accessing Bluetooth/WebView features
**Solution**: The code now handles missing dependencies gracefully with fallbacks

### 2. **Permission Denials**
**Symptoms**: Location/Bluetooth features don't work
**Solution**: Comprehensive permission handling with user-friendly error messages

### 3. **Network Issues**
**Symptoms**: Maps don't load
**Solution**: Static map fallback and proper error handling

### 4. **Yandex API Limits**
**Symptoms**: Maps stop working after many requests
**Solution**: API key is configured, monitor usage in production

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install react-native-ble-plx react-native-webview react-native-permissions

# For iOS (if building native)
cd ios && pod install

# Start development
npm start

# Test on different platforms
npm run web    # Web browser
npm run ios    # iOS simulator
npm run android # Android emulator
```

## Production Considerations

1. **API Key Security**: Move Yandex API key to environment variables
2. **Permission Descriptions**: Customize permission messages for your app
3. **Error Tracking**: Add crash reporting for production debugging
4. **Performance**: Monitor map loading times and optimize as needed

## Compatibility Matrix

| Feature | Web | iOS | Android | Fallback |
|---------|-----|-----|---------|----------|
| Bluetooth | ✅ Web API | ✅ Native BLE | ✅ Native BLE | Error message |
| Maps | ✅ Custom SVG | ✅ Yandex WebView | ✅ Yandex WebView | Static image |
| Location | ✅ Geolocation | ✅ Expo Location | ✅ Expo Location | Manual entry |
| Permissions | ✅ Browser | ✅ iOS prompts | ✅ Runtime requests | Graceful degradation |

All critical bugs have been identified and fixed. The app should now run successfully across all platforms with proper fallbacks for missing dependencies.
